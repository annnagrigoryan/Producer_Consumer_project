# Producer_Consumer_project

N Producers are filling up the Storage. When the size of the Storage is greater than some number (defined as minStorageSizeToProcess), the Consumer calculates the sum of numbers stored in the Storage. After that point, the Storage is reset, and the Producers continue their job.

This process continues maxIterationCount times.
